# Scrapping

My scrapping projects until now (sorted respectively):
* [x] SoundCloud top50 list
	* Using **request** library to get web page and applying few of **beautifulsoap** functions to scrape information I was looking for
* [x] Oscar winners from beginning of reward until 2017 
	* Using **Chrome Webdriver**, **Selenium** to automate process of populating search query and after I get results I want, data scraping is done with **beautifulsoup**.
	
* [x] Hand sanitizers during COVID-19 period for my Canadian client
	* Using **Chrome Webdriver**, **Selenium** to automate process of incrementing page of table, whole document is loaded in script and data from table filtered into csv file.

All data is saved in **.csv** form, to be used for further data manipulation and front-end client experience.

Used Frameworks and Programming Languages:
* **Python**
* **BeautifulSoap**
* **Selenium**

Used Libraries:
* **Request**
* **WebDriver**

*(all scripts are done just for practice and scraped data does not have any practical use to me)*
